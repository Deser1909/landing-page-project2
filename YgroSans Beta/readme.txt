Ygro Sans is a carefully designed typeface created on the concept of fluidity.
It combines a geometric foundation, a grotesque pedigree and a playful tone of voice.

Moreover it comes in three weights with a fairly complete set and it is completely free for you to download and use for your most spectacular design projects.

Use it well!
